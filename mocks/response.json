    "And the real challenge is to say, I can't fix somebody else. They're going to suffer. I might be helpful, but I can't help. I can't make their pain stop. But it's really, I mean, we're engineers. We wanna fix things, you know? And so we see that and that's just an impulse. And letting go of that for some reason is really hard.",

    "Sometimes compassion just involves being present with someone's pain and not trying to make it go away. Because again, if you are trying to like fix their pain, it's almost like you're saying to them, like you shouldn't feel this way and there's something wrong with you for feeling this way. And then that's not very compassionate because then they feel on top of feeling bad, they feel bad about feeling bad because they're bringing you down.",

    "When you are compassionate with yourself, I think it does kind of like give you a little bit of safety to feel like you have the capacity to be more compassionate towards others. And so, because you know that like you have this home base that's safe that you can come back to, I think that does help people open their heart a bit more.",

    "Kristen Neff, one thing that she always says is speak to yourself as you would a good friend. And so I think the implication there is most of us actually do know how to be compassionate with our friends to some degree. At least we know how to try. We might sometimes use some empathy blockers by accident when we're trying to help. We might try to fix them, et cetera. But we at least know what we're trying to do, which is to support our friends.",

    "What I found is with engineers, a lot of times what they care about most is the code. And so if I can start from, here's how, if you understand compassion and look at it, here's how it might affect how you name variables or how you design systems, or you know what I mean? Like how the architecture that you choose, the API design choices, if you can see how compassion might inform that, then I think that that helps them pay attention more."
