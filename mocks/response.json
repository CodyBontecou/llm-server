    "So I was like, I need to do something. So I learned about compassion in an interesting way. I was reading a bunch of books like sort of self-help psychology books, etc. One book that was helpful on this journey was self-compassion by Kristin Neff. And it was about how we don't have to beat ourselves up in order to like, you go to things like you can actually speak kindly to yourself and still You know decide to improve and learn things that was that was a big part of it",
    "And so I wrote a blog post about this called Confessions of a Recovering Jerk Programmer, where I talked about my thoughts that I needed to be a jerk programmer. And like, in my defense, I mean, I think that a lot of the famous programmers that we would put on pedestals from the past were a little bit rough around the edges in terms of their communication style, in terms of like, I'm thinking of like the leanest tour vaults of the world. And it's not a personal knock on him. It's just that his code review practices I think could be seen as a bit aggressive, the full of the expletives, full of, well this is a complete idiotic way of doing this, whatever kind of things. So I think that when you're in, especially coming into it as a woman and again, I'm not meaning to dwell on that, but I'm kind of from this group that like doesn't really fit in. And so I'm trying to fit in. It's the only look around, okay? And it's not like it was a conscious thing. I think it was subconscious, like, oh, I see the cool people around your kind of insult that the different technologies and kind of acts of peerier. And so I sort of took on some of those traits, even though it's not really who I am.",
    "And I love that, yeah, I love that, 'cause it's also like a mindfulness exercise as well. Like, you know, just even just the first step of like, you said, 'Looking at your hand.' Sometimes that will be enough to kind of center you in the moment and yeah."
