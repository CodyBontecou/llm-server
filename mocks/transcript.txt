- Well, and the nice thing is-- - The framework for-- - UBC. - It is a framework for MVC, and you've always got it with you. And so if you're just freaking out, you can always just look at your hand and start kind of using that as a structure. - I love that, yeah, I love that, 'cause it's also like a mindfulness exercise as well. Like, you know, just even just the first step of like, you said, "Looking at your hand." Sometimes that will be enough to kind of center you in the moment and yeah. - So tell us more about your journey And sometimes that will be enough to kind of center you in the moment. And yeah. Yeah. So tell us more about your journey and what you have, what you've been creating or trying to help people. Yeah. And what brought you to this? What was your sudden inspiration that you needed to learn? Yeah. So I felt a bit burnt out. Let's see. It must have been towards the end of 2015 early 2016. And I was kind of burned out on the industry for the reasons that I kind of mentioned. Also, I feel like I had been trying so hard to fit into this culture that you were talking about where it's like I have to make the other person wrong so that I feel right. And I wrote a blog post about this called Confessions of a Recovering Jerk Programmer, where I talked about my thoughts that I needed to be a jerk programmer. And like, in my defense, I mean, I think that a lot of the famous programmers that we would put on pedestals from the past were a little bit rough around the edges in terms of their communication style, in terms of like, I'm thinking of like the leanest tour vaults of the world. And it's not a personal knock on him. It's just that his code review practices I think could be seen as a bit aggressive, the full of the expletives, full of, well this is an idiotic way of doing this, what's this complete idiotic BS, whatever kind of things. So I think that when you're in, especially coming into it as a woman and again, I'm not meaning to dwell on that, but I'm kind of from this group that like doesn't really fit in. And so I'm trying to fit in. It's the only look around, okay? And it's not like it was a conscious thing. I think it was subconscious, like, oh, I see the cool people around to your kind of insult that the different technologies and kind of acts of peerier. And so I sort of took on some of those traits, even though it's not really who I am. And anyway, and so I did that for a while. And I like you so I can-- - You identified at some point, that didn't feel good to you. - To feel good. - Exactly, for the same reasons that we're talking about earlier, like you feel disconnected. It feels, you feel isolated and alone, and that's how I felt. And so I was like, I need to do something. So I saw the need to fix it in myself, or to at least kind of help myself grow and to learn those things. And so I learned about compassion in an interesting way. I was reading a bunch of books like sort of self-help psychology books, etc. One book that was helpful on this journey was self-compassion by Kristin Neff. And it was about how we don't have to beat ourselves up in order to like, you go to things like you can actually speak kindly to yourself and still You know decide to improve and learn things that was that was a big part of it I also went vegan around this time. I had been vegetarian for a little while, but I went vegan and in a lot of the vegan world they talk about compassion like having compassion for animals and so I actually went to a Retreat about compassion in the Bay Area. And it was specifically for vegans, but we talked about compassion more generally and like what it means and like the science around it. Because there's been more research now about compassion and what it looks like in the brain, you know, at least our current understanding of it.
